This map plots the waste management plants in Italy from 2015 to 2024, using the publicly available data from: https://www.catasto-rifiuti.isprambiente.it/index.php?pg=gestdownloadimp .
Waste management plants are localized at the center of the related municipality, using data from: https://www.istat.it/notizia/confini-delle-unita-amministrative-a-fini-statistici-al-1-gennaio-2018-2/ .

To create the map, I used Qgis and the qgis2web plugin, the format for the map is OpenLayers.
